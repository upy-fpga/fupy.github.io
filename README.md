## MicroPython on FPGA has moved!

The MicroPython on FPGA project has been renamed to FPGA MicroPython (FμPy),
and now has a new GitHub home at:

[FPGA MicroPython (FμPy)](//github.com/fupy/)

Please [visit the new GitHub organisation](//github.com/fupy) for more
information.

### Replacement git repositories

GitHub will automatically redirect many of the old GitHub 
repository references but not all of them.  For reference, the new
git repositories are:

*  `upy-fpga/micropython` -&gt; [`fupy/micropython`](//github.com/fupy/micropython/)

*  `upy-fpg/upy-fpga-litex-gateware` -&gt; [`fupy/fupy-litex-gateware`](//github.com/fupy/fupy-litex-gateware)

*  `upy-fpga/numato-mimasv2-pic-firmware` -&gt; [`fupy/numato-mimasv2-pic-firmware`](//github.com/fupy/numato-mimasv2-pic-firmware)

*  `upy-fpga/qemu` -&gt; [`fupy/qemu`](//github.com/fupy/qemu)
